            <abstract>
                <p>Special education researchers, practitioners, and policy makers continue to work toward developing
                    and implementing empirically supported practices and policies to address the academic, social, and
                    postschool challenges confronting students with emotional and behavioral disorders. The systematic
                    review has become an essential vehicle for compiling and disseminating research findings on an array
                    of topics. Given the importance and impact of these research summaries, it is instructive to take
                    stock of the extent to which reviews in our field adhere to current standards. Drawing from a number
                    of sources in the social and behavioral sciences, we propose and describe a series of quality
                    indicators for systematic reviews. We applied these indicators to systematic reviews published in <italic>
                        Behavioral Disorders
                    </italic> between 2005 and 2016 with the broader goal of identifying areas of methodological
                    strength and areas for improvement. Results indicate that the sample of systematic reviews
                    demonstrated particular strength in several procedural domains such as the specification of
                    inclusion criteria, identifying the electronic databases used for the search, and describing the
                    plan for data analysis. We also identified a number of areas to which researchers might devote
                    greater attention to increase the rigor of systematic reviews in the field. Findings are
                    contextualized within the importance of research transparency and reporting to improve practice and
                    policy.

        <p>The development, identification, and dissemination of evidence-based intervention and assessment strategies
            have been a dominant theme within education for more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                      rid="bibr24-0198742916688653">
                Shavelson &amp; Towne, 2002</xref>). Following the logic of evidence-based practice, rigorous research
            methods are used to determine which strategies are most likely to produce the desired outcomes (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0198742916688653">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>). A critical aspect of the
            identification of evidence-based educational methods is to reliably summarize the research on a given topic
            to assess the methodological strength and consistency of findings to draw meaningful conclusions. As such,
            the systematic review has gained increased attention for its emphasis on providing transparent assessments
            of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0198742916688653">Cook, Tankersley, &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>).
            Given the variety of academic, social, and postschool challenges confronting students with emotional and
            behavioral disorders (EBD), systematic research reviews can have significant implications and reach for
            guiding the adoption and implementation of various educational practices and policies for this particularly
            vulnerable population of students. For instance, the results of systematic reviews can be used by
            practitioners to select intervention methods, policy makers to weigh the costs and benefits of adopting
            particular strategies, researchers to identify the strengths and weaknesses within a body of research to
            assist with planning their next study, grant funders to determine issues that are in need of additional
            attention and resources, and the developers of standards to detect promising strategies and practices (<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0198742916688653">Talbott, Maggin, Van Acker, &amp; Kumm, in
                press</xref>). The strength of systematic reviews derives from the articulation of a clear, transparent,
            replicable methodology that increases the likelihood of drawing objective conclusions from the research
            being reviewed. As such, the systematic review has become an essential tool within the development and
            dissemination of empirically supported practices and policies for students with EBD (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                       rid="bibr18-0198742916688653">
                Maggin &amp; Chafouleas, 2013</xref>).
        </p>
        <p>Despite the importance of systematic reviews for understanding and addressing an array of complex issues for
            students with EBD, field-specific guidance for researchers or practitioners on this research methodology is
            currently unavailable. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to follow the lead of previous efforts in
            the field to establish guidelines and provide an overview of common quality indicators for conducting
            systematic reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0198742916688653">Odom et al., 2005</xref>). In the
            following sections, we define systematic reviews in relation to other types of literature reviews, describe
            common quality indicators for systematic reviews, and provide a conceptual discussion of the reasons these

            <title>Defining Systematic Reviews</title>
            <p>A systematic review is the attempt to systematically collate all empirical evidence that meets a set of
                specific eligibility criteria with the purpose of answering a particular research question (<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0198742916688653">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>). As such, these
                research syntheses require the development of clearly articulated procedures that are selected to
                minimize subjectivity and maximize transparency, which increase the likelihood of providing reliable
                findings from which objective conclusions can be drawn to support decision making for policy and
                practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0198742916688653">Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp;
                    Rothstein, 2009</xref>). It is essential not only to define systematic reviews but also to
                distinguish them from other types of literature reviews used in our field. For instance, systematic
                reviews are fundamentally different from narrative reviews and position papers in that researchers
                describe and use a replicable, transparent set of procedures to search, include, and review the research
                on a given topic. In contrast, narrative reviews typically do not provide details on how particular
                decisions are made regarding the relevance and consideration of the included studies (<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0198742916688653">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1997</xref>). This is not
                to discount the importance of narrative reviews; in fact, narrative reviews can often be a means for
                disseminating powerful scholarship and perspective. Another type of review that is common in our field,
                and one that is closely related to systematic reviews, is the meta-analysis. There is often confusion,
                however, regarding the differences between a meta-analysis and a systematic review. Meta-analysis refers
                explicitly to the use of statistical methods to summarize and combine the results of independent
                research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0198742916688653">Cooper, Hedges, &amp; Valentine,
                    2009</xref>). As such, a systematic review does not require the use of meta-analytic techniques
                although the validity of findings from a meta-analysis is directly related to the quality of the
                systematic review procedures used to reduce bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0198742916688653">

            <title>Guidelines for Systematic Reviews</title>
            <p>Part of the motivation for the current article is to provide researchers and research consumers with a
                set of guidelines to use when conducting and reviewing systematic reviews. These efforts are similar to
                the development of indicators for primary research proposed by our esteemed colleagues in special
                education more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0198742916688653">Odom et al.,
                    2005</xref>). The purpose of those methodological guidelines, as with those proffered here, was to
                encourage the use of strong research methods to ensure the most valid information is obtained and
                disseminated. It is important to note that the development of quality indicators has not been isolated
                to the execution of primary research studies in the field of special education. In fact, there have been
                several efforts to establish guidelines for conducting systematic reviews in other areas of the social
                and behavioral sciences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0198742916688653">American Psychological
                    Association [APA], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0198742916688653">Higgins &amp;

                These endeavors have led to the development of a set of widely accepted standards on the processes and
                procedures for conducting a rigorous systematic review. In the current article, we synthesize extant
                guidelines to generate a set of quality indicators for conducting and reporting rigorous systematic
                reviews in special education generally and in the field of EBD specifically.

                <title>Research Question</title>
                <p>As with all types of research, a rigorous systematic review begins with the articulation of the
                    research question that communicates the primary objectives of the review (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                    rid="bibr9-0198742916688653">
                        Cooper et al., 2009</xref>). Because systematic reviews can address a wide array of topics and
                    include a range of research designs, there are few formal criteria for presenting the research
                    question itself. Recommendations on the development of research questions for systematic reviews,
                    however, emphasize the need for them to be testable and to include explicit reference to the key
                    populations, variables, and objectives of the research to be sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                rid="bibr9-0198742916688653">
                        Cooper et al., 2009</xref>). That is, the research questions should unambiguously refer to the
                    necessary characteristics of the populations being sampled, primary variables of interest, and
                    intent of the review. The overarching goal of the research question is to clearly communicate the
                    population of studies that will be eligible for the review to the readership (Cochrane
                    Collaboration, 2013). For instance, if the purpose of the review is to determine whether a
                    particular intervention program has sufficient empirical support to warrant its use for reducing
                    anxiety experienced by students with EBD, the research question would reference the particular age
                    and grade levels of interest, the particular name or class of interventions that will be eligible
                    for the review, and the specific outcome measures considered. Similarly, if the systematic review
                    will examine the perceptions of students and school personnel on the implementation of a particular
                    school discipline policy for students with EBD, the review authors might indicate in the research
                    question that qualitative research literature on this topic will be reviewed in addition to sample
                    and variable characteristics that establish the boundaries of the studies to be included. Regardless
                    of the overall purpose of the review, the research question should be constructed so that it serves
                    as an advanced organizer to the reader and communicates the primary aims of the review and the key
                    details of the studies to be included.

                <title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
                <p>Following the development of a research question that provides readers with the critical details and
                    goals of the review, it is necessary to develop a set of criteria that clearly defines the
                    population of studies from which the research team will ultimately sample (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                     rid="bibr16-0198742916688653">
                        Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>). Whereas the research questions are meant to serve as an
                    advanced organizer for the reader, the eligibility criteria provide the operational characteristics
                    of the studies that will be included and excluded. The development and reporting of clear
                    eligibility criteria not only benefits the research team in preparing a transparent and replicable
                    review but also provides readers with the opportunity to determine whether the universe of eligible
                    studies was successfully secured. As such, the audience is then in a position to evaluate whether
                    the research question was adequately addressed and whether the main objectives of the review were
                    successfully achieved. Put simply, the development and reporting of clear and replicable eligibility
                    criteria is essential to both planning the research as well as evaluating the overall validity of
                    the review.
                </p>
                <p>The specific details of what should be included in the eligibility criteria will naturally depend on
                    the purpose of the review. However, most systematic reviews should address information such as (a)
                    the demographic, emotional, behavioral, and academic information that distinguishes the student
                    population of interest; (b) the contexts and settings in which the research has taken place; (c) the
                    pertinent constructs and outcomes and whether there are any restrictions on how these were measured;
                    and (d) the research designs or other methodological characteristics considered when identifying
                    studies (Davies, 2000). Providing detailed inclusion criteria for the particular sample
                    characteristics of interest can be particularly important given the range and complexity of the
                    emotional and behavioral challenges experienced by students with EBD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                      rid="bibr19-0198742916688653">
                        Maggin et al., 2016</xref>). As such, the more specific that review authors can be regarding the
                    focus of the research, the more specific the subsequent conclusions and recommendations can be as
                    well. Moreover, it is often necessary to specify methodological criteria to clearly communicate the
                    types of research designs eligible for addressing the review questions. Review of intervention
                    research for students with EBD in particular often requires noting the specific research designs
                    that were eligible for review given the range of experimental frameworks used across the literature.
                    As such, many systematic reviews will stipulate that only those studies that randomly assigned
                    participants to intervention or control conditions, used a particular quasi-experimental framework,
                    or applied single-case research methods would be eligible (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                     rid="bibr3-0198742916688653">
                        Borenstein et al., 2009</xref>). Ultimately, the development of the specific eligibility
                    criteria for each review will depend on its overall aims and purpose. It is important to note,
                    however, that precise eligibility criteria can assist researchers in executing a thorough and
                    efficient search process as well as making the review transparent, replicable, and interpretable.

                <p>Once the eligibility criteria have been established, the systematic review process moves away from
                    conceptual development toward implementation. The purpose of the search is to identify the universe
                    of eligible studies that meet the eligibility criteria. It is important to note that the strength of
                    the review largely depends on the extent to which all the relevant studies are successfully
                    identified and subsequently retrieved. Each individual study that is included in the review
                    contributes new information either by providing additional support or contrary evidence to the
                    results of the other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0198742916688653">Borenstein et al.,
                        2009</xref>). Because each research report contributes to the evidence base, the results and
                    conclusions of a systematic review are related to the extent to which all eligible research is
                    considered. Researchers must therefore clearly describe the procedures for searching the literature
                    to ensure all relevant research reports are identified. Many common strategies for searching the
                    literature base for studies are presented in the proposed quality indicators in <xref
                            ref-type="table" rid="table1-0198742916688653">Table 1</xref>. Examples of these procedures
                    include explicitly naming the electronic databases, including databases of unpublished studies and,
                    if applicable, research registries (i.e., publicly available database of ongoing and completed
                    trials) searched; listing the keywords used to identify reports within the electronic searches; and
                    describing any alternative procedures used to identify eligible reports such as hand searching
                    journals, examining the citation lists of previous reviews, or contacting authors and other subject

                <p>Providing a description of the procedures taken to identify studies enhances the transparency of the
                    process for readers and represents an important aspect of systematic reviews. In addition to these
                    procedural steps, a number of additional reporting standards address the extent to which the pool of
                    studies is reflective of the universe of possible studies on the topic. For instance, reporting the
                    qualifications of those individuals conducting the search is important for determining whether there
                    was sufficient expertise and experience, indicating whether there were language barriers that
                    precluded the identification and subsequent review of studies in languages other than English can be
                    an important limitation in many systematic reviews, and providing the date of the final search
                    allows consumers to determine whether the current review is up-to-date or whether additional
                    research might have been published on the topic. Because the intentional or unintentional exclusion
                    of relevant studies raises the possibility that the review findings are not representative of the
                    broader population of research findings, the reporting of these steps is essential to drawing valid
                    and transparent conclusions.

                <p>In addition to well-described search procedures, it is also important to provide a transparent and
                    replicable description of the retrieval process (<xref ref-type="bibr"

                    cases. The specific reasons for not obtaining copies of identified reports can vary although some
                    common reasons are that the particular record is unavailable either online or in print, the original
                    document was lost or harmed, or the research report is in a different language. Regardless of the
                    reason, there is almost always a portion of research reports that cannot be acquired. As such, it is
                    important for review authors to record those studies that were deemed either eligible or possibly
                    eligible but were not retrievable. Cataloging the number and proportion of papers that were
                    retrieved provides readers with vital information to evaluate the rigor and validity of the review.
                    Put another way, the validity of the results is compromised when only the easy-to-find studies are
                    included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0198742916688653">Gough, Oliver, &amp; Thomas,

                    eligible studies not obtained during the search with reasons for their omission.

                <title>Coding Scheme Development and Implementation</title>
                <p>The research questions in a systematic review are often addressed—in full or in part—through the
                    development of a coding scheme. These coding schemes are used to collect descriptive information
                    from the studies that can then be used to characterize the samples, outcome, and other key variables
                    of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0198742916688653">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>).
                    For example, in their review of disproportionality of English Language Learners with EBD, <xref
                            ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0198742916688653">Gage, Gersten, Sugai, and Newman-Gonchar
                        (2013)
                    </xref> collected demographic information that not only described the samples but also were used as
                    variables in the subsequent meta-analysis to examine variability in disproportionality rates. To
                    transparently and reliably collect this information, the authors need to develop a coding protocol,
                    which in turn guides the information they collect. It should be emphasized that the coding protocol
                    developed by Gage et al. was developed to address their research questions pertaining to the extent
                    of disproportionality and investigate the underlying patterns. Because coding schemes are developed
                    to address the research questions of a given study, the particulars of each protocol will inevitably
                    differ. Despite this inherent variability, specific coding categories can be employed in a majority
                    of reviews, given their importance for evaluating both the rigor and generality of research drawn
                    from various paradigms. These general coding categories and their content are reviewed in the
                    following sections.

                    <p>Methodological quality refers broadly to the degree to which the research design procedures

                        terms of their adherence to a range of methodological indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                rid="bibr17-0198742916688653">

                        of the research base to properly contextualize the results. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr"

                        classroom behaviors often did not include measures of procedural fidelity. Providing evidence
                        that the intervention was implemented as intended is critical for making claims that the
                        intervention was in fact responsible for positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr"

                        particular methodological issue and others, the authors were able to provide a more nuanced
                        overview of the evidence base aside from simply reporting the results. After all, the results of
                        a study are meaningful but must be interpreted in relation to the research design and the
                        various points where bias can be introduced. It is important to note that methodological
                        strength is a multidimensional construct with many different features and that there are no
                        perfect studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0198742916688653">Valentine, 2009</xref>).
                        Moreover, the relevant methodological features for a given review will depend on the type of
                        research being considered. Fortunately, researchers have developed methodological standards and
                        related tools that can address a large range of different designs including group-based
                        experimental designs, single-case research, measurement studies, and qualitative methods (e.g., <xref

                        that these quality indicators be used to evaluate and contextualize the strength of the findings
                        within systematic reviews.

                        however, even the results of the best designed studies require consideration of the individuals

                        example, a research team conducting a review on the effects of a reading comprehension
                        intervention for adolescents might consider a range of student characteristics and/or settings
                        in which the research has been conducted. Researchers can then ascertain the extent to which
                        interventions work for particular students in particular settings, and whether gaps exist that
                        can be addressed through future research.

                    <title>Describing the variables under study</title>
                    <p>Systematic reviews are compelling because they organize information across several sources to
                        draw conclusions that are more generalizable than those from a single study. This includes the
                        variability inherent across research participants and contexts included in different studies as
                        well as the variables and phenomena being investigated. As a result, those engaged in conducting
                        systematic reviews should aim to describe the patterns in the outcomes and other key variables
                        used across studies, including important moderator variables. Examples of important moderator
                        variables for systematic reviews of interventions include fidelity of intervention
                        implementation; duration, frequency, and intensity of intervention; and intervention cost (<xref

                        Examining variables across studies allows reviewers to ascertain what constructs researchers are
                        studying. Looking across studies, reviewers can determine the uniformity of construct
                        definitions. For example, reviewers might conduct a systematic investigation of variability in
                        operational definitions and data collection procedures for the independent variables, dependent
                        variables, and educational phenomena under study (<xref ref-type="bibr"

                        responsibility to develop an approach for capturing this variability in a systematic way, so as
                        to describe it to readers of the review.

                <p>The purpose of the current review was to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of research
                    published in <italic>Behavioral Disorders</italic> from 2005 to 2016 and evaluate them on a range of
                    established quality indicators for systematic review. Three individuals identified systematic
                    reviews and meta-analyses (two held doctorate degrees in special education and the third was
                    enrolled in a PhD program). These individuals are all study authors and each has experience
                    conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The following procedures were used to identify the
                    pool of studies reviewed for the current article. First, the authors conducted a hand search of all
                    copies of <italic>Behavioral Disorders</italic> published between January 2005 and May 2016. This
                    hand search included the review of each title and abstract of papers published across these years to
                    determine whether the article should be read in greater detail. The hand search resulted in the
                    identification of 24 systematic reviews published over the aforementioned time period. Second, an
                    electronic search of these journal issues was also conducted as an extra measure to ensure that all
                    relevant papers were identified. This electronic search was conducted in ERIC and executed with the
                    following Boolean phrase: pub(“Behavioral Disorders“) AND (“meta-analysis” OR “systematic review” OR
                    “literature review”) with a delimiter also applied to the time frame to ensure returns between the
                    dates of interest. The electronic search returned a total of 309 papers with a majority of these
                    published in other journals with titles containing the term “Behavioral Disorders.” The research
                    team therefore discarded those papers published in other journals and reviewed the titles and
                    abstracts of the remaining papers. This process resulted in the identification of zero additional
                    papers being included in the present review. Each of the 24 papers identified was then retrieved as
                    a portable document format (PDF) and placed into an electronic file-sharing folder that all members
                    of the research team could access.

                <p>The inclusion criteria used to select research reports for the present review were based on (a) the
                    journal of publication and (b) the methodological procedures used within the studies. Broadly,
                    studies were included if systematic review procedures were employed to address the research
                    question. More specifically, systematic reviews were differentiated from other research approaches
                    and less structured reviews if (a) the stated purpose of the research was to review extant
                    literature and (b) there was a formal method section included in the article that described the
                    process for selecting, searching, locating, and analyzing previously existing research studies.
                    Regarding this latter criteria, literature reviews that were developed using narrative rather than
                    systematic procedures were excluded from the present review. Moreover, there were no qualifications
                    placed on the type of research that was included in the original review and, therefore, could
                    include randomized or quasi-experimental, single-case, qualitative, and other research methods.
                    Moreover, the search was restricted to systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 2005
                    and 2016 to align with the publication of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) methodological
                    quality indicators, which are widely viewed as a watershed development in the field, raising the
                    standards for research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0198742916688653">Odom et al., 2005</xref>).

                    of these methodological domains and the items used to operationalize them. The seven methodological
                    domains include (a) the search procedures reported, which relate to the extent to which the authors
                    were able to identify the universe of studies related to the research question; (b) the inclusion
                    and exclusion criteria used within the review, which provide a basis for identifying studies that
                    are relevant to the research questions; (c) the procedures used to retrieve studies deemed eligible,
                    including explicit reference to relevant studies that could not be obtained; (d) the methods used to
                    screen studies, which allows readers to evaluate whether the studies were consistently and
                    accurately assessed for eligibility; (e) the procedures associated with implementing a coding scheme
                    and related data collection processes; (f) the content of the coding scheme, which is essential for
                    readers to determine the variables and issues that the research team considers most important in
                    relation to the research question; and (g) the methods used to analyze the data, which encompasses
                    both the approaches used to aggregate the descriptive results of the coding scheme and to synthesize
                    the results across studies. All of the items were evaluated as either being present or not present

                <title>Coder Training and Agreement</title>
                <p>Two research assistants who had varying levels of expertise and experience with research methods
                    conducted coding. The lead coder was a doctoral student in special education who had taken courses
                    in research design and statistics and had experience in the conduct of previous systematic reviews.
                    The secondary coder was also a special education doctoral student with no previous experience with
                    systematic review procedures. Prior to initiating study coding, the research assistants underwent
                    training that consisted of the following procedures: (a) an introduction to the study and the coding
                    protocol presented by the lead authors; (b) practice coding a subset of reviews and meta-analyses
                    that would have been eligible for the study, except for their publication year (i.e., publication
                    year prior to 2005); and (c) computing agreement statistics for the reviews used for coding practice
                    until there was at least 90% agreement across coders for all codes. Coders were then given studies
                    to code independently, with the lead coder assigned to review all of the eligible studies and the
                    secondary coder assigned a random subset of 30% of the studies to establish interrater agreement.
                    Interrater agreement was computed using a percentage agreement formula in which total agreements for
                    each code were divided by the total agreements plus disagreements. Mean percentages across coders
                    for each methodological domain are presented in <xref ref-type="table"

            <p>The purpose of this article was to provide an overview and rationale for rigorous systematic review
                methods to ensure that the information drawn from these reviews is the most valid and current available.
                To examine the extent to which systematic reviews published in <italic>Behavioral Disorders</italic> were
                consistent with the proposed standards, we applied the quality indicators to reviews published in the
                journal from 2005 to 2016. Findings indicated several areas of distinct strength with additional areas
                in need of more attention among the 24 reviews. Before discussing the specific findings of our review,
                it is worth briefly considering the importance that systematic reviews have for stakeholders in the
                fields of special education and EBD. As the field continues to place more emphasis on the importance of
                research in guiding the selection of practices and policies, it is critical that stakeholders have
                access to the most recent and accurate information on which to make decisions. The systematic review
                ultimately represents the most valid and reliable vehicle for examining and synthesizing research
                findings across studies to inform the development of empirically grounded sets of practices and
                policies. As such, it is necessary to take stock of the methods being used to identify both strengths
                and weaknesses to ensure that the field is producing the most dependable information to improve the
                outcomes and lives of students with EBD. In the following sections, we describe specific areas of
                strength and areas in which the field might improve.

            <sec id="section29-0198742916688653">
                <title>Quality Indicator Application</title>
                <p>The application of the review indicators led to the identification of several areas of strength
                    across the included reviews. For instance, there were a number of specific methodological criteria
                    that were present across all of the reviews. Examples include the specification of inclusion
                    criteria, noting the particular special educational label necessary for inclusion, and providing
                    information on the total number of studies in the review. The methodological domain with the
                    greatest adherence across the reviews was the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. As
                    such, it appears that systematic review authors have effectively established the boundaries of the
                    review for their intended audiences. In fact, many of the criteria that were consistently
                    implemented across the reviews reflected procedural components that could be replicated by other
                    researchers. As others have pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0198742916688653">
                        Travers, Cook, Therrien, &amp; Coyne, 2016</xref>), the notion of replicability is central to
                    the scientific endeavor and is mandatory for developing research-based practices, programs, and
                    policies. Within the context of systematic reviews, providing enough procedural information to
                    replicate a systematic review allows others to evaluate the strength of the research and to confirm
                    or challenge the validity of the research process.
                </p>
                <p>The consistent adherence on the part of reviewers in providing detailed descriptions of the review
                    procedures is certainly encouraging. Of course, there were some procedural areas where more
                    consistent reporting is needed, such as describing the process for training coders on the coding
                    scheme, providing details on the process for resolving coding disagreements, and addressing the
                    methodological quality of the included studies. An examination of the quality indicators that were
                    not consistently implemented reveals that many are related to the need to better report the results
                    of the procedural indicators. For instance, the majority of the studies did not provide information
                    on the reliability of the screening process, the total number of citations returned in the
                    electronic search, and the number of total studies screened out during the search process. Rather
                    than relate to issues of the reproducibility of the procedures, these indicators relate more to
                    issues of transparency of the review. Research transparency is a multidimensional construct and is
                    central to developing and disseminating empirically based information (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                 rid="bibr6-0198742916688653">
                        Cook, 2014</xref>). In the current context, transparency refers to the process of providing
                    specific information that would assist others in understanding and replicating the review process.
                    Reporting the number of studies identified through a particular database, for example, allows others
                    to verify the results of the search process. The information that appears to be missing most
                    consistently across the sampled reviews, therefore, would allow others to empirically corroborate
                    the review procedures. Including this information seems to be a worthy advance for review authors to
                    strive toward, as our field continues to pursue the use of the most rigorous research methods at our
                    disposal.

                <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
                <p>The dissemination of rigorous research designed to address the complex and varied needs of students
                    with EBD is an essential mission of <italic>Behavioral Disorders</italic>. In the present article,
                    we outlined a series of quality indicators for conducting rigorous systematic reviews and applied
                    these indicators to reviews published in <italic>Behavioral Disorders</italic> between 2005 and
                    2016. The results of this application led to the identification of several areas of methodological
                    strength and some areas that have tended to be overlooked. Researchers engaged in conducting
                    systematic reviews to inform practice and policy related to students with EBD are encouraged to use
                    the current pilot standards as a guide to ensure the most rigorous systematic review methods are
                    used to disseminate the most valid and reliable information. We conclude with some considerations
                    for the foregoing research.

                <p>It is instructive to consider some of the challenges associated with conducting a rigorous systematic
                    review. Among the primary challenges in our discipline is the tendency of systematic reviewers to
                    generalize the results too broadly and to assume that the results apply to all students with EBD. It
                    is our observation that researchers conducting a systematic review will often not describe the
                    conceptual reasons a particular intervention or program is expected to work and for whom (<xref

                        2015</xref>). Fortunately, there are published examples in which these conceptual links are
                    brought to the forefront. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0198742916688653">Bruhn,

                    students with behavior problems. Rather than group all self-monitoring interventions together and
                    assume the same components, these authors examined the underlying practices used in each study and
                    their connection to issues of behavioral function. As a result, the authors were able to provide
                    clear and direct guidance to the reader on whether self-monitoring interventions worked, for whom,
                    and under what conditions. It is worth noting that the process of integrating theoretical,
                    contextual, and methodological nuances across studies is not an easy endeavor. However, it is
                    incumbent on the review authors to make these connections explicit for the reader. More attention to
                    the sample characteristics and conceptual underpinnings of the practices and policies identified as
                    evidence-based by systematic reviewers will allow for more targeted use of effective methods.

                <p>It is also important to discuss some of the challenges of applying quality indicators to bodies of
                    research. To be sure, assessing methodological quality is an important endeavor and one that is
                    necessary to accurately contextualize research reports (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                  rid="bibr27-0198742916688653">
                        Valentine, 2009</xref>). Despite these advantages, there is also a need to constructively use
                    sets of quality indicators with the understanding that these are essentially research instruments
                    that are subject to the same issues of validity and reliability as those quality indicators used
                    within primary research. As such, additional vetting of the quality indicators forwarded here and
                    their application to special education research is needed. Fortunately, recent research has provided
                    a template of how such a process might be pursued (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                             rid="bibr7-0198742916688653">Cook et al.,
                        2014</xref>). Finally, it may be tempting to assume that systematic reviews that address fewer
                    indicators are of lower quality. In many instances, this might be the case although there might also
                    be examples in which the particular research being reviewed or the focus of the review might
                    preclude the implementation of all criteria. It is our recommendation, therefore, that future
                    applications of these and other indicators be used more to describe the current status of research
                    in a particular area rather than be used for evaluative purposes.
